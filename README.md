## Project Title:

EduTrack Application

## Project description:

This project focuses on designing and developing EduTrack, a Java-based personalized academic planner. Designed to enhance time management skills, reduce course-related stress, and improve study habits, EduTrack aims to help college students achieve higher grades. The motivation for this project arises from the need for a more effective academic planner, as poor time management is a significant factor contributing to academic failure. The initiating phase is crucial as it involves clearly defining the problem. Studies show that poor time management is a leading factor in getting below-average academic success among students.
