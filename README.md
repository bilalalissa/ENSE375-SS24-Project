## Project Title:

EduTrack Application

## Project description:

This project focuses on designing and developing EduTrack, a Java-based personalized academic planner. Designed to enhance time management skills, reduce course-related stress, and improve study habits, EduTrack aims to help college students achieve higher grades. The motivation for this project arises from the need for a more effective academic planner, as poor time management is a significant factor contributing to academic failure. Through a structured engineering design process and rigorous testing methodologies, including boundary value testing, equivalence class testing, and use case testing, this project aims to deliver a robust and reliable solution to aid college students in managing their academic responsibilities more efficiently. For a project to succeed, it must progress through several key stages: initiating, planning, executing, and closing. The initiating phase is crucial as it involves clearly defining the problem. Studies show that poor time management is the leading cause of subpar academic performance among college students. This research explores the project's problem by discussing and answering key questions.
