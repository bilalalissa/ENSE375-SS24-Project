# EduTrack Project Report

## 1. Introduction

EduTrack is an application designed to manage users, courses, tasks, and schedules efficiently. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive tool for managing educational activities, enhancing productivity, and ensuring effective organization of academic responsibilities.

## 2. System Overview

The system comprises several key components:
- **UserManager**: Manages user signup, signin, logout, profile updates, and account deletion.
- **CourseManager**: Manages courses including adding, updating, deleting, and searching courses.
- **TaskManager**: Handles tasks related to courses.
- **ScheduleManager**: Manages daily, weekly, monthly, and semester schedules.
- **ExportManager**: Facilitates the export of user, course, and schedule information.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 User Management
The `UserManager` class is responsible for handling all user-related operations such as signup, signin, logout, updating profiles, and deleting accounts.

### 3.2 Course Management
The `CourseManager` class manages course-related activities including adding new courses, updating existing courses, deleting courses, and searching for courses.

### 3.3 Task Management
The `TaskManager` class handles tasks associated with courses, including adding, updating, deleting tasks, and listing tasks by course.

### 3.4 Schedule Management
The `ScheduleManager` class manages different schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, semester) and provides methods to view these schedules.

### 3.5 Export Management
The `ExportManager` class enables the export of user, course, and schedule information to external files.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

The EduTrack application successfully integrates user, course, task, schedule management, and export functionalities. Future work could focus on the following areas:
- **Improving Task Management**: Enhancing the user interface for task management to provide better usability and functionality.
- **Improving Schedule Management**: Adding features such as automatic reminders and notifications for scheduled tasks and events.
